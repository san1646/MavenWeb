Knighted WBS addedd to the Technology tab.
Form submission problems have been resolved. 
The data is being received in the controller method (/technology, POST).
Clean is required, the WBS Collapsible was muted for development work.

Things to do-
Unmute the collapsible, and make a Service Layer call from the TechnologyController to save user data in to the database.

The collapsible form is working! yay
User data is being saved to the database.
Ajax integration was not required. But it might be required for better UI functionality.

To do-
make the redirection after form submit to better page than "createProject" ( it loses the decorator in redirection )
Add cookie functionality so that data and collapsible can be persisted.

To do-
Ajax request to get the total hours. Get the total hours for the current project from the database.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Find Project - Using search functionality, user can find existing projects. Only the project id search has been implemented.
Future developments - Make search multi-valued and dynamic query generation. 

2. Edit Project - Search query returns a project. This project can be edited using Edit. Edit will basically forward the Project
 object to create Project module. 
Future dev. - Populate all the tabs using given project info. and make it editable.

3. CSS Links in JSP - Added the configurable use of CSS. theme-plm.properties file stores the link for CSS under 'jquerystyle' attr.
Using MessageSource, it can be passed on to the JSP via the Controller. Only 'findProjectResult' View has been configured. Rest has 
to be done when time permits.

4. Username display - Display username on the right corner of all the screens

5. List current projects on the Home screen

6. DataTable integration for Home screen project grid; (Downgraded jQ version to 1.8.2)

7. Bug - after session timeout, the Spring security f/w takes the control to login page.
Here, the session object was found to be null. Fixed the bug by setting create-session="always" in http in security context xml.

Lot of new stuff added!
1. WBS form is now submitted through ajax. The flow remains on the same page.
2. Cost page is revamped.
3. Started using Mylyn plugin for task management in Eclipse.
4. Project_Kwbs - This entity now has all the Project and KnightedWbs intersection. New project will spawn new inserts in to Project_Kwbs only on 
first time creation. Subsequent saves will just update the existing rows. I created a stored function to handle this case.
5. Project Status - home page data grid shows the current project status. Project/general tab has facility to update the status manually. ajax call
is used to update the status.
6. Other minor improvements - Chrome compatibility, total hours working
